# G. Motors

## Summary
In this section of the course, I implemented open-loop control of movement in my robot (see a [previous branch](https://github.com/eiokonji/ludobots_cs349/tree/e-joints) for more on robot generation) which allowed it to move on its own. 

To do this, I added motors to the joints of my robot and configured the parameters determining how the motor would control the joint's movement. Next, I implemented open-loop control which ensured movement without the robot "listening" to its sensors. So, instead of sensors driving locomotion, I used a sinusoidal vector to guide the motors in moving the robot.
