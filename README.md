# F. Sensors

## Summary
In this section of the course, I added sensors to the robot generated in the [previous branch](https://github.com/eiokonji/ludobots_cs349/tree/e-joints). After importing [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) and [Matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/), I stored the collected sensor data in an array and represented it in a plot.

## Deliverables
Here is a link to the [video deliverable](https://youtu.be/VZOddmrmbf0) showing how the sensor values change when the robot is in contact with the floor (```sensor value = 1```) and it's not (```sensor value = 0```). These values are represented in the plot below:
