# K. Random Search
## Summary
In this section of the course, I simulated multiple robots with randomly generated synaptic weighting systems which produced the desired locomotion. 

I implemented this simulation using the random search method. I first generated a fully interconnected neural network where all motor and sensor neurons were connected using synapses. Then, generated multiple simulations of different robots using the os library's [os.system command](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.system).
