# CS396: Artificial Life

This repository was created and updated while I took Northwestern University's Artificial Life Seminar with Professor Sam Kriegman. This seminar was focused on studying "life as it could be" and explored evolution through simulation. It is  influenced by Dr. Josh Bongard's MOOC on ludobots which is referenced on each branch.

Each branch of the repository correlates to an assignment completed for this course and the repository is largely divided into three sections:
  - **Understanding Simulation with Pyrosim**: Navigate from branch ```b-simulation``` to ```j-synapses```.
  - **Implementing Search Algorithms**: Navigate from branch ```k-randomsearch``` to ```m-parallelhillclimber```.
  - **Generating Multi-Dimensional Creatures**: Navigate from branch ```n-quadruped``` to ```r-assignment8```.

Enjoy navigation!
