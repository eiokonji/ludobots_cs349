# D. Many Links
 
## Summary
In this section of the course, I explored applying forces, planes and procedural generation of link in the simulated world. I used the physics engine pybullet module (a python-wrapped version of the C++ bullet library) to apply the forces to the world and visually generate a "floor" or base plane. I also generated a tower of blocks of decreasing size.
